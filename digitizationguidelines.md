This document is intended as a guide to digitization, specifically image and metadata capture for Revolutionary City: A Portal to the Nationâ€™s Founding, a collaborative digital project using Islandora software. It will be updated as modifications in the equipment, software and/or metadata schema necessitate.

##**Preparing the Work Station**  
Before any digitization takes place, the technician should ensure that all of the following conditions have been met:
* Work on a clean, roomy, and tidy work table. Ensure that the work table is large enough to accommodate the objects and their housing enclosures.
Be sure that the scanner bed and workspace are clean and free of dust. Use the lint-free cloths, if necessary.
* Wash and dry hands before working with library materials.
* Determine materials and supplies needed and gather them prior to digitization. This includes book supports, chlorine-free nitrile (medical) gloves for handling photographs, flatbed scanner inserts for digitizing slides, etc.
* Use only pencils near library materials. No ink or felt tip pens or markers, colored pencils, crayons, etc.
* Keep work spaces free of food and drink.
* Close books and folders and cover collection items when leaving the work area.
* Do not leave valuable items unattended while away from the workspace.
* Remove and replace materials in their containers carefully.
