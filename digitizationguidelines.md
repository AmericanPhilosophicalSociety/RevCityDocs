This document is intended as a guide to digitization, specifically image and metadata capture for Revolutionary City: A Portal to the Nation’s Founding, a collaborative digital project using Islandora software. It will be updated as modifications in the equipment, software and/or metadata schema necessitate.

## **Preparing the Work Station**  
Before any digitization takes place, the technician should ensure that all of the following conditions have been met:
* Work on a clean, roomy, and tidy work table. Ensure that the work table is large enough to accommodate the objects and their housing enclosures.
Be sure that the scanner bed and workspace are clean and free of dust. Use the lint-free cloths, if necessary.
* Wash and dry hands before working with library materials.
* Determine materials and supplies needed and gather them prior to digitization. This includes book supports, chlorine-free nitrile (medical) gloves for handling photographs, flatbed scanner inserts for digitizing slides, etc.
* Use only pencils near library materials. No ink or felt tip pens or markers, colored pencils, crayons, etc.
* Keep work spaces free of food and drink.
* Close books and folders and cover collection items when leaving the work area.
* Do not leave valuable items unattended while away from the workspace.
* Remove and replace materials in their containers carefully.

## **Handling Materials**
It is vital to assess the physical condition of materials before subjecting them to digitization. Please contact the project supervisor or on-site supervisor if you have any questions or concerns about digitizing any item or if you encounter any of the following issues:
* Folds or creases obscuring text
* Cockled, undulating paper or photos that would be damaged by scanner pressure
* Tears greater than 1”
* Books with loose joints or detached spines or boards
* Restricted bindings
* Signs of active mold such as soft, furry spots. Active mold is sticky and can smear. Inactive mold is dry and powdery. Excessive powder should be sent to the conservation lab for clean up.
* Difficult formats, such as scrolls, accordion books, panoramas, or oversized items

### **Special Handling Notes**:
* Bound material:
  * BINDINGS: Weak, damaged, or restricted bindings require special care to prevent further damage. Handle, open, and close these items gently and using both hands. During image capture, place these items in a book cradle.
  * BRITTLE PAPER: Handle brittle paper with extreme care. Artwork, documents, manuscripts, prints, photographs, and their mounts can also be brittle. Use clean hands to handle paper.
  * FOLDOUTS: Don’t remove foldouts from books. Carefully open the foldout onto a support (like a board) during image capture.
  * IRON GALL INK: As much as is possible, avoid touching areas of iron gall ink, as this promotes further corrosion.
  * LOOSE ITEMS: A book may contain loose items between its leaves that may need to be temporarily removed to allow digitization of the contents of a given page. Make note of the item’s location, image the item itself, and then immediately replace it following image capture.
  * PAGE FLATTENING: Don’t apply heavy pressure to books in order to flatten them for image capture.  Such pressure can break the spine or loosen or break off brittle pages in a book. If a page cannot be imaged without being held down, options for applying gentle temporary pressure at the edges with book weights, silk thread, or polyethylene straps can be explored with the guidance of a conservator.
* Unbound textual material:
  *  BRITTLE PAPER: Handle brittle paper with extreme care. Artwork, documents, manuscripts, prints, photographs, and their mounts can also be brittle. Use a microspatula and clean hands to handle paper.
  *  IRON GALL INK: As much as is possible, avoid touching areas of iron gall ink, as this promotes further corrosion.
  *  OVERSIZE MATERIAL: Flatbed scanners cannot safely accommodate objects larger than 12.25” x 17” (Epson Expression 12000XL) or 11.5” x 16.5” (Epson GT-15000), therefore oversize material should be scanned on the CopiBook OS XD Book Scanner.

## **Scanning Equipment and Specifications**
The type or medium of a material affects which tools are necessary to digitize it. Bound materials, unbound textual materials, maps and oversized graphic materials require different quality standards and imaging equipment.

APS maintains a variety of scanning, imaging, and digitization equipment. Their specifications are listed below:

Equipment name | Type of equipment | Max scan area (H x W) | Best for 
--- | :---: | --- | :---:
Epson Expression 12000XL | Flatbed scanner | 12.25” x 17” | Photographic prints, photographic transparencies, graphic materials, unbound textual materials (manuscript or printed) 
Epson GT-15000 | Flatbed scanner | 11.5” x 16.5” | Photographic prints, graphic materials, unbound textual materials (manuscript or printed)
CopiBook OS XD | Overhead scanner | 20” x 28” | Maps, oversize graphic materials, bound volumes (manuscript or printed) 
CopiBook Cobalt | Overhead scanner | 20” x 28” | Maps, oversize graphic materials, bound volumes (manuscript or printed)
