This document is intended as a guide to data entry and descriptive cataloging for _The Revolutionary City: A Portal to the Nation’s Founding_, a collaborative digital project using Islandora and Drupal software. It is designed to help the creator of the record metadata decide what information is required, which field is the best choice for the information, and the format in which the information should be entered.  It will be updated as modifications in the software and/or metadata schema necessitate.

## **Each field includes the following information**
**Field name:** Display label for the name of the field in Islandora.  
**Definition:** A combination of MODS definitions, Islandora Workbench definitions, and APS modifications as appropriate.  
**Obligation:** A statement about whether the field is required, required if applicable, recommended, or optional; and information about whether or not you can have more than one value in the field (i.e. repeatable or not repeatable).  
**Enter Data in Spreadsheet Column:** The corresponding column heading in the Workbench spreadsheet to enter the data. The column name indicates to Workbench which field to add value and must be exactly as the drupal machine name is spelled/formatted.  
**Type of field:** The type of data that can be entered into a particular field.  
**Application:** Specification on formatting and tips for entering data into a particular field.  
**Example(s):** Sample data that would be acceptable in this field.  

## **General Information and Guidelines**
* The terms “item,” “resource,” and “object” have been used interchangeably throughout these guidelines. An “item,” “resource,” or “object” can be a number of different things including a an individual document, a folder of documents, a photograph, a photo album (filled with many photographs), a journal, a diary, an account book, a published book, a recorded oral history, a scrapbook, a map, an atlas, a postcard, a video or audio recording etc.
* Be consistent in your use of the metadata fields.
* One row in the Workbench spreadsheet equates to one Drupal node. A node is created to hold descriptive metadata about content in the repository.
* If you have no data for a metadata field, **leave it blank**; do not enter “N/A” or “None” or question mark.
* Ending punctuation is not required for field content and is only recommended in fields where complete sentences are used (e.g. abstract, notes).
* Do not use ampersands (“&”) to connect sentence elements. An ampersand should only be used when it is part of an official corporate name or logo.
* Where multiple values are appropriate in a repeatable field (names, subjects, languages, etc.), you **must** separate them with a pipe (|) and no spaces in between values when entering into the workbench spreadsheet.
* Avoid the use of abbreviations. Writing words out enables users to find items consistently and also helps to avoid confusion (such as abbreviating both County and Company to “Co.”). An exception to this rule is the use of “St.” in a city or place name (e.g. St. Peter, St. Paul or St. Benedict).
* **Spell-check your metadata.** After entering your information into the MIK spreadsheet, run the spell check to catch any misspelled words. Also, verify the spelling of local place names and individual’s names that may not be caught during the spell-check process.

**For contributors:**
* Review the list of metadata fields prior to beginning data entry for your collections. You should look for fields that are designated as “Required.” Required fields must contain a value (if one is known). Contributing organizations must complete all required fields.
