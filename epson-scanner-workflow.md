This document serves as a guide for digitization practices supporting The Revolutionary City: A Portal to the Nationâ€™s Founding, a collaborative digital project utilizing Islandora and Drupal platforms. Specifically, it is intended to guide project staff in the use of the Epson Expression 12000XL flatbed scanner to produce high-quality digital surrogates of original materials. It outlines:

* The required technical specifications for scanning  
* The appropriate settings and file formats for various material types  
* The naming conventions and file organization protocols to be followed  

This document will be updated as needed to reflect changes in software, hardware, or digitization standards.

1. Turn on the scanner and allow it to warm up for a few minutes before starting.
2. Clean glass before each scanning session and as needed.
3. Load the Epson Scan 2 software from the computer.
    * Note: You may need to turn on the scanner, hit refresh on software and choose scanner in order to run software.

4. Determine scan specs by consulting [Digitization Guidelines](https://americanphilosophicalsociety.github.io/RevCityDocs/digitization/) or Workflows Guide.
    * On the left hand of the screen you will see the Settings. There are two tabs: Main Settings and Advanced Settings.  
    * In the Main Settings menu, choose the appropriate settings.

5. Adjust settings for files to be created. This is done at the bottom left of the screen.
    * Image Format: TIFF (always!)  
    * File name: Follow standard for file naming conventions (See step 6).  
    * Folder: Before scanning begins it is important to create a folder where the scans are going to be sent. All scanning should be done to the public drive or external hard drive. Consult Digitization Guidelines or Workflows Guide for [folder naming and structure](https://americanphilosophicalsociety.github.io/RevCityDocs/digitization/#file-storage).

6. Set up the file name conventions.
    * The Prefix should contain the collection number (with underscores instead of periods) and a hyphen to separate the sequential files. The Number of Characters should be padded for 3. The Start Number reflects the page sequence of the current item.
    * In the example above we are scanning material from the Gratz Family papers (Mss.Ms.Coll.72). The file shown is the 53rd folder in the collection and the first item in the folder will be named Mss_Ms_Coll_72_053-001. Each additional scan will be Mss_Ms_Coll_72_053-002, Mss_Ms_Coll_72_0053-003, and so on until a new folder is ready to be scanned.
